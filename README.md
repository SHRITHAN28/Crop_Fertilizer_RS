# Week1
Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System
In this project, we leverage machine learning to recommend the most suitable crop and fertilizer based on environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The system aims to promote sustainable agriculture by optimizing crop selection and fertilizer usage.
##Progress for the week1 
###Dataset Exploration:
-Conducted an in-depth analysis of the Crop Recommendation Dataset.
-Ensured data consistency by checking for missing and duplicate values.
-Summarized the statistics and distributions of numerical features.
###Data Visualization:
-We visualized the relationship between temperature and humidity using a line plot, and scatter plot for insights.
-Plotted the distribution of crop types and crop frequency using a count plot.
-We used a histogram to distribute temperature values in the dataset.
###Key Observations:
-Temperature data follows a normal distribution, centred around 25Â°C.
-The dataset is well-balanced across crop types, ensuring robust model training.
-Humidity values are clustered around 80%.
-The optimal temperature and humidity area is 20 to 30 degrees with 80% humidity.
